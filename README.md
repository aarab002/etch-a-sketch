# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch is a project which is part of my TOP js course.This is my first ever trilingual project comprising of HTML,CSS,JS.
This is exactly how an etch-a-sketch works with you being able to draw on a grid container with monchromatic black color or variuos random colors with varied opacity as well!Further changes will be made to this repo as i enhance my expertise in JS and hence make it more interactive and fun.  
If you dont have any idea how etch-a-sketch works,try it! as its not complicated after all,suggestions for further changes/new ideas are appreciated.
